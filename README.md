# vuesplit README

This extension split a vue file into 3 files.

The purpose is to view 3 sections of vue files: template/script/style. Because we often jump between those sections, eg. add class name in template section, then create this class in style section. So it may reduce some jumps and some memory burden.

## Features

Press shift+ctrl+v (the default shortcut key) to split current vue files into three files.
